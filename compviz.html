								<h3>Projects Overview</h3>

								<p>The following projects were completed as a part of the Udacity Self Driving Car Nanodegree and Simplilearn AI Masters Program Each, explores different aspects of computer vision applications required in a real self driving car, to ensure a deep understanding of the working of the various components involved within. See below for an overview of some of the projects!</p>

										<h3>Traffic Sign Classifier</h3>
										<p>Traffic Sign Classification is a fundamental issue that a self driving car should be able to distinguish, the signs should be accurately classified in order to avoid unexpected scenarios during control</p>

									  <p>in this classifier the German Traffic Sign Dataset was used with 25k images trained on LeNet, the architecture devised by Yaan Le Cun for document classification, I tested the network on VGG16 as it was iterated upon the existing networks and which won the IMAGEnet challenge in 2015</p>

										<h3>A* Search Algorithm</h3>
										<p>The <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm" target="blank" > A* algorithm</a></b> is a popular AI search algorithm for robot motion planning. The project focused on developing an "online" variant, which could only observe adjacent cells, to allow the simulated robot to plan as it moved. The challenge was to formulate an optimized distance formula and heuristic algorithm, two of the biggest design considerations with A*, to navigate a 2D field with obstacles. The graphic shows the results of the algorithm circumnavigating an arbitrary barrier setup with ease. </p>

										<p>Once A* had planned the path, an IK (Inverse Kinematic) motion controller was implemented to drive an imaginary puck-style robot along the route. Many challenges had to be overcome, including tuning the controller to account for dynamic considerations (e.g. max velocity and acceleration constraints).</p>

										<h3>Monte Carlo Localization</h3>
										<p><b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_localization" target="blank" >Monte Carlo Localization</a></b> (MCL) is a powerful localization algorithm. At the core of MCL is a particle filter, a non-parametric approximation of a Bayesian filter (<i>e.g.</i> Kalman). Particle filters represent the robot's posterior by particles, or individual <i>possible</i> states of the robot.</p>

										<p>The accompanying animation shows the particle filter I implemented (blue line) correctly tracking the ground truth path (green line). For reference, the purely dead-reckoned path is shown in red. Looking very closely at the forefront of the blue path, you can make out the particle cloud (black arrows), although they're hard to distinguish due to their density - there are 500 in close quarters. If you observe closely, you'll see the particles splay out each step, and those towards the edge of the cloud eventually disappear after the resampling step.</p>

										<p>Localization techniques such as this are at the core of SLAM and autonomous navigation technology, and implementing one from scratch was a great learning experience!</p>

										<h3> Lane Finding</h3>
										<p>This Project involves python and OpenCV to develop an analytical pipeline that can be ued to automate the lane line detection in image and movie files</p>

										<p>The project was structured accordingly :Building the Vision Pipeline consisting of gaussian Bblurring, defining areas of interest, graysacling to detect sharp transitions, along with canny edge detection, to detect patterns, features in an image by thresholding the pisel densities, along with Hough line transfrom to accurately mask the areas of interest, the model was then tested on both images and a set of videos with frames at 30 fps, with a industry standard accuracy</p>
